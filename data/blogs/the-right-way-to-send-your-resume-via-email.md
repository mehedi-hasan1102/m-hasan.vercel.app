A cover letter plays a crucial role when applying for a job. It gives recruiters a primary-level understanding of your experience and skills. While your resume lists your skills and experiences in bullet points, a cover letter allows you to:

**Summarize key points from your resume**

*(1) Share your personal interests and motivation
(2) Showcase your knowledge about the company
(3) Explain why you’re a great fit for the role*

In short, a cover letter tells your career story and highlights both your technical and interpersonal skills in a more personal and compelling way.
